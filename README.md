# 💥 Project 12 — Bank System (OOP)

## 📖 Description

The **Bank System (OOP)** project is a **complete redesign and evolution** of the previous procedural bank system.  
This version is fully engineered using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to achieve a **modular, maintainable, and extensible** software structure.

It applies every OOP concept learned throughout the course **_“OOP as it should be (Application)”_** with **Dr. Abu Hadhoud**  
👉 [www.programmingadvices.com](https://www.programmingadvices.com)

The project was developed step by step — watching, understanding, and implementing each stage — transforming theory into real-world coding experience.  
Each phase (or “Extension”) adds new functionality while demonstrating the power of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in practice.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Refactor the old **procedural bank system** into a robust **OOP-based architecture**.
* Apply the **four pillars of OOP** effectively:
  - 🔒 **Encapsulation:** Protecting data and controlling access.
  - 🎭 **Abstraction:** Hiding unnecessary details to simplify usage.
  - 🧬 **Inheritance:** Reusing and extending functionality efficiently.
  - 🔄 **Polymorphism:** Enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
* Build a **layered architecture** separating:
  - **Presentation Layer (UI)**
  - **Business Logic Layer**
  - **Data Access Layer**
* Design the system for **scalability**, **clean code**, and **ease of modification**.

## 🧱 System Overview

The project simulates a **real-world banking system** with all major operations:

- Manage clients and user accounts.  
- Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.  
- Log login attempts and transactions.  
- Assign and verify user permissions.  
- Secure the system with role-based access control.  
- Automatically display current date and logged-in user on all screens.  
- Lock the system after three failed login attempts.  
- Generate reports and audit records.

Each of these functionalities was added gradually through **9 structured extensions**, each focusing on a new concept or system improvement.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```text
📂 Bank-System
 ┣ 📁 Core
 ┃ ┣ clsPerson.h / clsUser.h / clsBankClient.h
 ┃ ┗ clsScreen.h / clsMainScreen.h
 ┣ 📁 BusinessLogic
 ┃ ┗ Transaction and Access Control Classes
 ┣ 📁 Data
 ┃ ┗ File Handling and Storage
 ┣ 📁 UI
 ┃ ┗ Screens and Menus
 ┗ main.cpp
```


This structure allows easy debugging, testing, and future scalability — reflecting how large enterprise systems are organized.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* 💻 **C++** — main implementation language.
* 🧰 **Object-Oriented Design (OOP)**
* 📁 **File-based Data Storage**
* 🧮 **Bitwise Operations** for permission handling.
* 🧠 **Encapsulation & Inheritance** for reusability and abstraction.

## 🧩 Extensions Implemented

Each extension adds a new layer of functionality to the system:

| Extension | Feature | Key Concept |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 01 | Add Date and Logged-In User to All Screens | Inheritance |
| 02 | Lock the System After 3 Failed Logins | Encapsulation |
| 03 | User Permissions & Access Control | Abstraction |
| 04 | Transaction Screens (Deposit/Withdraw/Transfer) | Polymorphism |
| 05 | Login Records and Audit Trail | Data Persistence |
| 06 | Transfer Screen | Modularization |
| 07 | Manage Users Screen | Access Management |
| 08 | Show Total Balances | Aggregation |
| 09 | System Polishing & Final Improvements | Scalability |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways — The Power of OOP

Working on this project was more than just coding — it was **a mindset transformation**.  
At first, OOP felt complex and abstract, but through consistent practice, it became a **natural way of thinking**.

Here’s what we learned:

* Adding a new feature (like showing the current user and date) took **only a few seconds** — one edit in the base class affected the whole system.
* When everything is **structured and inherited properly**, maintenance becomes effortless.
* Using **abstraction**, we hid private logic that users didn’t need to see — keeping interfaces clean and simple.
* The system **grew larger but stayed organized**, thanks to OOP and the **divide-and-conquer** approach.
* This same system could easily continue to grow for years — because its foundation is solid and scalable.

💡 **That’s the real power of Object-Oriented Programming** — it’s not just about syntax; it’s about thinking, designing, and scaling like a true software engineer.

## 🧾 Final Notes

This repository represents a full educational journey — from procedural coding to professional OOP design.  
Every line of code was written with understanding and purpose.

🚀 The next step will be to build **another OOP project** to further reinforce these principles — pushing our design, abstraction, and coding skills to the next level.
