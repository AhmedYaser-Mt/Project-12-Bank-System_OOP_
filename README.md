# 🚀 Project 12 — Bank System (OOP)

## 📖 Description

The **Bank System (OOP)** project is a **complete redesign** and **expansion** of the previous bank system (procedural version). This time, the system is fully rebuilt using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, aiming for a **structured, reusable, and extensible** design.

It implements **all OOP concepts and features** covered in the course *OOP as it should be (Application)*.

📌 This project is being developed step by step **alongside our instructor (Dr. Abu Hadhoud)** [www.programmingadvices.com]. He demonstrates the code, explains it in detail, and we follow along by running, understanding, and applying it ourselves. The project is built in **phases, parts, and steps**, since we are still in the learning stage. The instructor is guiding us on how to build complete projects using OOP.

👉 I will be uploading **each phase separately** on GitHub and LinkedIn, with full details for better learning and documentation.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Refactor the old procedural bank system into an OOP-based system.
* Apply key OOP concepts:

  * 🔒 Encapsulation
  * 🎭 Abstraction
  * 🧬 Inheritance
  * 🔄 Polymorphism
* Implement a layered architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
* Support both **core** and **advanced** banking operations.
* Ensure code is **maintainable, testable, and extensible**.
